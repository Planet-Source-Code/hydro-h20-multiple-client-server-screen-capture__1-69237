' This is the extended version which allows memory handles, and optional
' staggered offsets & background preservation. See how simple the original
' version looked. Its at end of this module

' PARAMETERS
' destDC :: the DC where the tileBlt will occur
' destRect :: a rectangle structure, in pixels, where in the DC the tileBlt will occur
' sourcePicObjectOrHandle :: can be a picture object or an image handle
'   - Picture Object examples: Image1.Picture, Picture1.Picture, Picture1.Image, stdPicture
'   - Handle :: Image1.Picture1.Handle, memory image handle
'   Supported image types include bitmap, jpg, gif, icon & cursor
' Following parameters used primarily for transparent tiles
' bStaggered :: will offset alternating rows by 1/2 the image width
' bNoEraseBkg :: option to preserve destination DC & tile over it.
'   This option should only be used only for transparent tile images (icons,cursors,gifs)
'   - If False, then the destDC backcolor will be used for base of TileBlt
'   - If True, then the destDC will be copied & routine will TileBlt over it
'     This will be somewhat slower, since the tiled image needs to be converted
'     to a transparent bitmap then overlayed on the destination DC
' TransparentColor :: only used if bNoEraseBkg is True
'   - The transparent color of the source image. -1 will use the top left pixel color

' //////////// OVERVIEW COMMENTS \\\\\\\\\\\
' pretty fast Tile Bltter - compatible with Win95
' Why not just use CreatePatternBrush, right?
' Wrong... that API can only use a maximum of an 8x8 image in Win95.
' Ok, don't care about Win95, what about speed comparisons anyway?
' Using following test scenario & begin timing after offscreen DC & patternbrush created:
' -- Using CreatePatternBrush 1000 times on full screen bitmap: amazing avg of 20 secs
' -- Using my routine 1000 times on a full screen bitmap: avg of 6 secs
' The above test was done using a 48x48 bitmap

' Typical tile bltters will tile an image n number times the image width until the
' image surpasses the destination width & then blt the row vertically in similar fashion.
' Tested using a destination area of 1,000 x 1,000 & image of 16x16, typical routines:
'   63 blts across (1000/16= 62.5) & 62 blts down (don't need to blt over 1st row)
'   for a total of 125 loops to completely fill the area. But...
' This routine, however, does incremental blts, using the image for the 1st blt only,
' then recursing over the previously bltted parts to blt even larger areas. Using
' the same dimensions above, the incremental bltter used only 14 loops.

' 1st loop: 16 pixels blt total
' 2nd loop: 32 pixels blt total
' 3rd loop: 64 pixels blt total
' 4th loop: 128 pixels blt total
' 5th loop: 256 pixels blt total
' 6th loop: 512 pixels blt total
' 7th loop: finished the remaining 488 pixels for total of 1000 x 16
' 8th thru 14th loop: using the entire top row & same algorithm going vertically down
' 14 loops compared to 125 with typical routines
